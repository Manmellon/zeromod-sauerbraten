installation on unix-like systems:
to compile this mod on unix-like systems you may need to install additional packages.
this mod requires zlib library and headers, and optionally geoip library and headers (for geoip support)
on debian-like systems you may use:
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libgeoip-dev build-essential
to compile this mod on unix-like systems, use: `make -C src install_server`
or, if you want to build client too: `make -C src install`
for cleanup, use: `make -C src clean; make -C src/enet clean`
please be aware, that on enet changes build system will not detect difference and thus needs to be cleaned manually.
modifying default server-init.cfg is not recomended, as it may introduce conflicts on later repository updates. copy it to separate folder where you want to run server from, and edit it there.
install_server installs server binary into bin_unix/ directory, feel free to copy this binary whether you need.
you can get list of server-init.cfg options by changing to src directory and typing:
grep -E '(^COMMAND|^ICOMMAND|^VAR|^SVAR)' engine/server.cpp fpsgame/server.cpp fpsgame/aiman.h fpsgame/ctf.h fpsgame/z_*
in case you want geoip support, you need to download geoip databases. download_geoip.sh script can do it for you.
